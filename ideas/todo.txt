    alt leveling -> for every max level char you have, you gain more xp.
        I want players to experience every new zones and their content if they want to, but I will not force them
        overall I'm making every race's leveling experience as distinct as possible, to avoid player burnout
        
    special class:race combos -> unlocks an additional talent tree for your class depending on your race

        whitemane as npc in stormwind
            able to talk to her, when you do:
                [glare intensely at her]
                "what is it bruv"
                "weren't you high inquisitor of the scarlet crusade?"
                "yea fam tyrande cured me from my insanity tho, the crusade thought I turned infected so they chased me out lmao crazy stuff"
                "tyrande...?"
                ... after crusade quests, last npc is tyrande in darnassus ...
                "tyrande fam why the fuck did you help sally whitemane"
                "i dont trust sylvanas lmao shes a bitch so we need all the allies we can muster"
    
    items
        mounts
            now every flying, giant or other bs mount is exotic
            exotic mounts cant be used in azeroth at all (no giant dragons blocking stormwind)
            exotic mounts can be used in outland and northrend but can only fly in specific flying zones (storm peaks and netherstorm for instance), 
            serve as some sort of attunement and gold sink
        
    dungeons
        prime: max level dungeons, pre-raid bis loot and cool profession supplies
        mythic: 10-man prime dungeons, some low-tier raid boss equivalent gear, cool cosmetics, more droprate
        
        deadmines
            on vancleef: instead of fighting him, you talk to him -- "this is unnecessary, vancleef, prestor manipulated you", you explain whats up
            a dragonspawn appears mad af and you guys (including vancleef) fight him as final boss
            its quest will give you a dragonbane scroll that you can use to seal its power and reduce his difficulty, if you don't use it its hardmode
        
        rfc
            hungerer hardmode: kill last boss first (the satyr guy)
            spawn pit lord in his place at 80% hp
            pit lord casts howl of chaos 2sec channel, sends feared dumbasses to lava
            
        scarlet monastery
            give it more importance
            whitemane not there (see quests)
    
    raids
        10 man n/h prime
        20 man n/h prime, drops cosmetics and cool mounts (ony/sartharion mount for instance), legendary pieces (shadowmourne for instance)
        40 man mythic, drops 8 n/h loot, huge cosmetics (al'ar, invincible, etc) and legendaries. overall optional
